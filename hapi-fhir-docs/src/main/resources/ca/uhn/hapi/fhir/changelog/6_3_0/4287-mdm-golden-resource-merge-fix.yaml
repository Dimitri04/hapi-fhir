issue: 4287
type: fix
title: "
      Fixed bugs with merging 2 Golden Resources together:
      1. When merging PG1 into PG2, the result was (incorrectly)
      PG2 REDIRECT PG1.
      2. When merging POSSIBLE_DUPLICATE links from PG1 to PG2,
      or PG2 to PG1, depending on order, a dangling self-referential
      link would sometimes remain (eg, PG1 POSSIBLE_MATCH PG1)
      Both of these have been resolved.
